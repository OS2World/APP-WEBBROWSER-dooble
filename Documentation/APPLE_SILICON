Apple Silicon requires signed software and therefore a bundled
package will be considered tarnished.  We recommend a Homebrew
solution. Please visit https://brew.sh and install Homebrew.

> brew install git
> brew install qt
> cd
> git clone https://github.com/textbrowser/dooble dooble.d
> cd dooble.d
> qmake -o Makefile dooble.pro
> make -j 5
> open ./Dooble.app
